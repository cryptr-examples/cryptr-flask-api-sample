# Cryptr with Flask API

## 01 - Configuration

🛠️️ First, create a directory for your project and go to that directory

```bash
mkdir cryptr-flask-api-sample
cd cryptr-flask-api-sample
```

🛠️️ Next, create the virtual environment with the virtual env command, and a name for your virtual environment. We can specify which version of Python we want to use. Here, it is Python 3.

```bash
virtualenv env -p python3
```

That creates a new directory called env, with all of the Python requirements to run that virtual environment.

🛠️️ Activate the virtual environment, with the following command: `. env/bin/activate`
